# tiltSwitch-Motor
A tilt switch is a mechanical device, containing a metal ball which connects(closes) the circuit when the tilt switch is upright.
When the board is upside down the circuit is disconnected(open) preventing current from flowing. Remember that current will only 
flow only if the circuit is closed (that goes for any other electric circuit aswell).

 In the diagram above, you could how observe how the tilt switch comes into play. The diagram on the left shows a tilt switch upright 
 indicating the ball closes the circuit allowing current to flow. Whereas the diagram on the right shows a tilt switch tilted on its 
 side causing the ball open the circuit not allowing current to flow.
