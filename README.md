# tiltSwitch-Motor
A tilt switch is a mechanical device, containing a metal ball which connects(closes) the circuit when the tilt switch is upright.
When the board is upside down the circuit is disconnected(open) preventing current from flowing. Remember that current will only 
flow only if the circuit is closed (that goes for any other electric circuit aswell).

 In the diagram above, you could how observe how the tilt switch comes into play. The diagram on the left shows a tilt switch upright 
 indicating the ball closes the circuit allowing current to flow. Whereas the diagram on the right shows a tilt switch tilted on its 
 side causing the ball open the circuit not allowing current to flow.

I have circled the tilt switch in green, if that breadboard were tilted (the tilt switch would tilt aswell). This is will cause the 
current to stop flowing and hence stop the fan from spinning. This could be used as a safety mechanism for your project, for example
imagine if you had a car which when upside down would still spin its wheels wasting energy, whereas this issue could be solved using 
the tilt switch.
